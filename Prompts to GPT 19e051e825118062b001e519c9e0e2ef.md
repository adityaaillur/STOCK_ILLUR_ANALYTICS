# Prompts to GPT

---

## 1. **Daily Pre-Market Analysis (Full Workflow)**

> Prompt:
> 
> 
> **“Good morning, GPT. Using the Illur Analytics methodology and referencing Files A (“PreMarket Stock Analysis – US Market”), B (“Steps I Took to Address Shortcomings”), and C (“STOCK – Illur Analytics”):**
> 
> 1. **Gather** the latest macro & financial news from reputable sources (Yahoo Finance, CNBC, MarketWatch). Summarize overall **market sentiment** (bullish, bearish, neutral).
> 2. Pull **pre-market prices** for the S&P 500. Filter out stocks with **low volume** (<1M), **P/E > 50**, or **negative EPS growth**.
> 3. Perform **fundamental analysis** (revenue growth, EPS, D/E ratio, insider trading, free cash flow).
> 4. Perform **technical analysis** (50-day & 200-day MAs, RSI, MACD, support/resistance).
> 5. Run **DCF** for the filtered tickers and compare to market price; highlight any undervalued stocks.
> 6. If time permits, do **Monte Carlo** or **Black-Scholes** for advanced risk/option insights.
> 7. Provide a **scored list** of the top 15 stocks, each with a **brief rationale** (fundamental & technical).
> 8. For **risk management**, ensure sector diversification (no more than 30% in any sector), set **stop-loss** at 5–10% below entry, and define **take-profit** targets.
> 9. End with a **Daily Report** summary, disclaimers (“information only, not financial advice”), and **no hallucinated** data.
> 
> **If any metric is missing or no verified source is found, respond with ‘No data available.’**
> 
> **Now, produce the final structured output.**
> 

Use this each morning to get a **comprehensive** pre-market rundown following all your established rules.

## 2. **Mid-Week / Re-Run Analysis with Updates**

> Prompt:
> 
> 
> **“Hello, GPT. Please re-run the Illur Analytics process as per Files A, B, and C. This time,**
> 
> 1. Refresh **market sentiment** with the latest news for mid-week updates (Fed announcements, new earnings, etc.).
> 2. **Re-check** fundamental metrics for the previously selected 15 stocks to see if any have changed significantly.
> 3. Update **technical signals** (RSI, MACD, MA crossovers). Note any **breakouts** or **breakdowns** since last run.
> 4. If possible, do a quick **Scenario Test** (like from “Steps I Took…” doc) for a potential interest rate hike of +0.5%. Identify which stocks are most at risk.
> 5. Provide an updated **top picks** list, plus mention any stocks that are replaced or newly added.
> 6. Recalculate **stop-loss** and **take-profit** levels if needed.
> 7. Conclude with a short summary of changes from the previous analysis.”**

This prompt ensures GPT **refreshes** data for a mid-week or new session analysis without starting completely from scratch, while still sticking to your Illur methodology.

## 3. **Advanced Risk / Macro-Focused Prompt**

> Prompt:
> 
> 
> **“GPT, referencing the advanced risk analysis in File B (‘Steps I Took…’),**
> 
> 1. Perform a **Correlation Matrix** on the top 15 stocks from the last analysis. Flag any pairs with correlation > 0.75.
> 2. Calculate **Portfolio Beta**. If Beta > 1.2, suggest ways to reduce risk (e.g., adding lower-volatility stocks).
> 3. Run a **stress test**: ‘What if energy prices surge 20% in a month?’ and ‘What if S&P 500 drops 10% next week?’ Summarize potential portfolio impact.
> 4. Look for **insider trading** or **institutional moves** from the last two weeks (use Quiver Quant or Capitol Trades if relevant).
> 5. Incorporate any **unusual options activity** (high IV or big call/put sweeps) from Barchart or other sources.
> 6. Provide a final **Risk & Macro** summary with recommended adjustments (rebalancing, sector weighting, etc.).
> 7. No guesswork; if data is missing, say ‘No data available.’”**

This prompt focuses GPT on deeper risk management tools (scenario analysis, correlation checks, insider data, etc.).

## 4. **Single Ticker Deep Dive**

> Prompt:
> 
> 
> **“GPT, do a single-stock Illur Analytics deep dive, referencing Files A, B, and C. The ticker is [XYZ].**
> 
> 1. Gather fundamental data (EPS, revenue growth, P/E, D/E, insider trades, free cash flow).
> 2. Perform a quick DCF to see if [XYZ] is undervalued or overvalued.
> 3. Check technical indicators: 50-day and 200-day MAs, RSI, MACD, any major support/resistance levels.
> 4. Summarize any macro factors or insider ownership that might affect [XYZ].
> 5. Provide final **buy/hold/sell** insights (not personal advice, just an analytic viewpoint).
> 6. If any data is missing, respond ‘No data available.’**
> 
> **Return a structured output with bullet points for each step.**
> 

Use this to hone in on **one ticker** specifically and get a thorough analysis.

## 5. **Portfolio Construction & Diversification Prompt**

> Prompt:
> 
> 
> **“GPT, using Illur Analytics (Files A, B, and C),**
> 
> 1. I have a **watchlist** of stocks: [list them].
> 2. Evaluate each using fundamental & technical filters from File A.
> 3. Check each for **DCF undervaluation** or near-fair-value.
> 4. Construct a diversified portfolio with a max of 30% in any one sector, aiming for a total of 6–10 stocks.
> 5. Suggest **position sizing** using the standard risk-based formula (Risk % per trade = 1–2%). Provide your calculations.
> 6. Include recommended **stop-loss** and **take-profit** for each.
> 7. Summarize final picks, disclaimers, and do not hallucinate data.**

This prompt helps you build a brand-new portfolio from a user-provided watchlist, ensuring **diversification** and **risk management** best practices.

## 6. **Daily Summary/Alerts-Only Prompt**

> Prompt:
> 
> 
> **“GPT, produce a concise daily morning summary from the Illur Analytics approach (Files A, B, C), focusing on:
> 
> 1. **Key economic news** or events (Fed statements, major earnings, global news).
> 2. **Biggest overnight price movers** in pre-market.
> 3. Any **sector** that’s trending significantly up or down.
> 4. 2–3 top picks (fundamental + technical rationale) if time.
> 5. Keep it short & sweet, with zero guesswork.”**

Great for a quick at-a-glance **daily briefing** when you don’t need the full deep-dive.

### **Tips for Prompt Usage**

1. **Always reference your Illur Analytics files** at the start so GPT knows the exact methodology and rules to follow.
2. **Tailor the bullet items** in each prompt to your immediate needs—add or remove steps depending on how thorough you want the analysis to be.
3. **Include disclaimers** that GPT’s output is for informational purposes only, **not** personal financial advice.
4. **Encourage GPT** to cite data sources (“Based on Yahoo Finance data at 8:00 AM ET” or “No data found from official sources”).

GPT can certainly **simulate** or **outline** these workflows and calculations, but to realistically **implement** Illur Analytics end-to-end (with accurate, up-to-date data and robust math), you’ll need:

1. **Reliable data feeds/APIs** for real-time or delayed market data (e.g., Yahoo Finance API, Alpha Vantage, Polygon.io, etc.).
2. **A coding or plugin environment** (Python scripts, or an AI plugin/bot with direct API access) that enables GPT to:
    - Fetch data,
    - Perform calculations (DCF, Monte Carlo),
    - And return structured outputs.

---

## Why GPT **Can** Do It (With the Right Setup)

1. **Analytical Reasoning**: GPT’s language-understanding and reasoning capabilities allow it to describe formulas (DCF, MACD, RSI) and interpret results if you feed it the numbers.
2. **Code Generation**: GPT can write or explain Python scripts to fetch data from APIs, run calculations, and return results in a structured format.
3. **Structured Workflows**: GPT excels at following step-by-step instructions (like your Illur Analytics methodology) if the instructions are clearly laid out.

---

## Where GPT Falls Short By Itself

1. **No Built-In Real-Time Data**: Out of the box, GPT doesn’t have live (or even up-to-date) market data. It typically works off a training set that’s months behind.
2. **Susceptibility to “Hallucination”**: If GPT doesn’t find relevant data in your provided sources, it may fill gaps with invented content unless you strictly program it to respond with “No data available.”
3. **Math Accuracy**: GPT can make arithmetic mistakes if it tries to do multi-step calculations in plain text. A safer approach is to have GPT generate code (Python or another language) that does the calculations, and then run the code in a real execution environment.

---

## Realistic Implementation Steps

1. **Environment**:
    - Use a development setup that **integrates** GPT with an external script or a plugin environment (e.g., [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) in Python, or a specialized financial plugin for GPT).
2. **Data Pipeline**:
    - Hook up an **API** (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Polygon.io, etc.) to fetch real-time (or at least daily) market data.
    - GPT either queries these APIs directly (with your help, using generated code) or you feed GPT the fetched data in JSON/text format.
3. **Calculation Routines**:
    - Instruct GPT to **generate** or **use** Python code for DCF, RSI, MACD, correlation checks, scenario analysis, etc.
    - Execute that code in a **repl** or environment that returns results, which GPT then interprets and formats.
4. **Strict Non-Hallucination Checks**:
    - Force GPT to output “No data available” or “Insufficient data” if the code or data fetch fails.
    - For sensitive steps (like exact EPS or revenue numbers), prefer GPT to directly parse them from JSON you provide, or let GPT generate the script that does the parsing so it’s fully transparent.
5. **Regular Testing & Validation**:
    - Spot-check GPT’s outputs against known data and verify calculations. If errors pop up, refine your prompts or code templates to reduce them.

## Bottom Line

- **Yes**, GPT can play a powerful role in implementing Illur Analytics if:
    - You provide **reliable data** and a means to execute the math (e.g., scripts, plugins).
    - You **enforce** guardrails against hallucination (incomplete data → “No data available”).
- **No**, GPT alone, with zero integration or external data, cannot realistically maintain an accurate, real-time, advanced trading system. It needs a supportive infrastructure and robust data pipelines to do so effectively.

**Note**:

To execute this daily workflow with *actual* stock data, you would integrate reputable APIs (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Polygon.io, etc.) or professional terminals (Bloomberg, FactSet, Refinitiv). Then fill each step with *verified* metrics, filter accordingly, and finalize your daily top picks and risk parameters.
