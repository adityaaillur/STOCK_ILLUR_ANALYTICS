# **PART 2: Fundamental & Technical Analysis Calculations**

(*This step ensures to perform deep financial analysis using fundamental & technical indicators to identify high-potential stocks.*)

---

**Task Name:** Daily Pre-Market Stock Analysis (Part 2: Fundamental & Technical Analysis)

**Objective:**

Perform **fundamental & technical analysis calculations** using stock market data collected in Part 1. Identify strong stocks based on financial health, growth potential, and technical indicators.

---

### **1. Fundamental Analysis Calculations**

(Assess the financial health & valuation of each stock)

✅ **Revenue Growth Calculation**

- Formula:
    
                         `$\text{Revenue Growth} = \frac{\text{Current Year Revenue} - \text{Previous Year Revenue}}{\text{Previous Year Revenue}} \times 100$`
    
- Select stocks with **consistent revenue growth > 10% per year** for the last **3-5 years**.

✅ **Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth Calculation**

- Formula:
    
                               `$\text{EPS Growth} = \frac{\text{Current Year EPS} - \text{Previous Year EPS}}{\text{Previous Year EPS}} \times 100$`
    
- Select stocks with **positive EPS growth for the past 3 years**.

✅ **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio Calculation**

- Formula:
    
                `$P/E=Stock PriceEarnings Per Share (EPS)P/E = \frac{\text{Stock Price}}{\text{Earnings Per Share (EPS)}}$`
    
- Remove stocks with **P/E > 50** (overvalued) and **P/E < 0** (negative earnings).

✅ **Debt-to-Equity Ratio Calculation**

- Formula:
    
                                               `$D/E = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Shareholder Equity}}$`
    
- Prioritize stocks with **D/E < 1.5** (low debt).

✅ **Insider Trading Analysis**

- Scrape **insider buying/selling data** from SEC filings and market sources.
- Flag stocks where **executives are buying shares** (positive signal).

✅ **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Calculation**

- Formula:
    
                                `$\text{FCF} = \text{Operating Cash Flow} - \text{Capital Expenditures}$`
    
- Select stocks with **positive & increasing FCF** (indicating strong financial stability).

---

### **2. Technical Analysis Calculations**

(Identify bullish stocks based on price trends & market strength)

✅ **Moving Averages (MA)**

- **Golden Cross** (Bullish Signal):
    - Occurs when the **50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA**.
- **Death Cross** (Bearish Signal):
    - Occurs when the **50-day MA crosses below the 200-day MA**.
- **Select stocks with a Golden Cross and avoid Death Cross stocks**.

✅ **Relative Strength Index (RSI) Calculation**

- Formula:
    
                                                         `$RSI = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + RS}$`
    
    *(Where RS = Average Gain / Average Loss over 14 days)*
    
- Select stocks with **RSI between 40-70** (avoid overbought stocks above 80 and oversold stocks below 30).

✅ **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) Calculation**

- Formula:
    
                                             `$MACD = \text{12-day EMA} - \text{26-day EMA}$`
    
- Identify stocks where **MACD crosses above the signal line** (bullish momentum).

✅ **Support & Resistance Analysis**

- Use historical price patterns to **identify key support & resistance levels**.
- Select stocks **breaking out of resistance with high volume**.

✅ **Volume & Liquidity Check**

- Select stocks with **high trading volume (>1M shares/day)** to ensure liquidity.

### **3. Scoring System for Ranking Stocks**

(*Assign scores based on fundamental & technical performance to rank stocks objectively.*)

| Metric | Weight | Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue Growth | 20% | Higher growth gets higher points |
| EPS Growth | 15% | Positive growth is prioritized |
| P/E Ratio | 10% | Lower is better (but not < 0) |
| Debt-to-Equity | 10% | Lower is better (<1.5) |
| Insider Buying | 10% | Stocks with recent insider buying score higher |
| Free Cash Flow | 10% | Positive & increasing FCF gets higher points |
| Moving Averages | 10% | Golden Cross is a positive indicator |
| RSI | 5% | RSI between 40-70 is ideal |
| MACD Crossover | 5% | Positive MACD crossover gets points |
| Breakout & Volume | 5% | Stocks breaking resistance with high volume get a boost |
- **Final Score Calculation:**
    - Combine all scores and **rank stocks from highest to lowest**.
    - The **top 15 stocks** move to the final selection phase.

# **PART 3: Advanced Quantitative Models (DCF, Monte Carlo, Black-Scholes)**

(*This step makes you use mathematical models to estimate stock valuation, risk, and price movements, ensuring a scientific approach to stock selection.*)

---

**Task Name:** Daily Pre-Market Stock Analysis (Part 3: Advanced Quantitative Models)

**Objective:**

Perform deep quantitative analysis using advanced financial models to refine stock selection. This includes **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation**, **Monte Carlo simulations for risk assessment**, and **Black-Scholes modeling for options pricing**.

---

### **1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model**

(*Determines the intrinsic value of a stock based on future projected cash flows.*)

**DCF Formula:**

                                                         `$DCF = \sum \frac{C_n}{(1 + r)^n}$`

Where:

- `$C_n$ = Future cash flow at year`
- `$r$ = Discount rate (Weighted Average Cost of Capital - WACC)`
- `$n$ = Number of years in projection`

✅ **Steps:**

1. **Retrieve the company’s free cash flow (FCF) for the last 5 years**.
2. **Estimate future cash flows** using an appropriate **growth rate (5-10%)**.
3. **Select an appropriate discount rate `$(r)$`:**
    - Use **WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital)** from sources like Yahoo Finance.
4. **Sum all discounted future cash flows** to calculate the stock’s **intrinsic value**.
5. **Compare intrinsic value vs. current stock price:**
    - **If DCF > Market Price → Stock is undervalued ✅ (Good for investment)**
    - **If DCF < Market Price → Stock is overvalued ❌ (Avoid investment)**

✅ **Final Output:**

- **List of undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals**.

---

### **2. Monte Carlo Simulation (Stock Price Prediction & Risk Analysis)**

(*Uses probability distributions to predict stock price variations and assess risk.*)

✅ **Monte Carlo Process:**

1. **Use historical price data** to model stock returns.
2. **Apply Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) for simulation:**
    - Formula:
        
                                                        `$S_t = S_0 \times e^{(\mu - 0.5\sigma^2)t + \sigma W_t}$`
        
    - Where:
        - `$S_t$` = Future stock price
        - `$S_0$` = Current stock price
        - `μ`  = Expected return (mean of historical returns)
        - `$σ$`   = Volatility (standard deviation of returns)
        - `$W_t$` = Wiener process (random variable)
    1. **Run 10,000 simulations to predict future stock price movements**.
    2. **Determine probability of price increase or decrease**.
    3. **Risk Analysis:**
        - Stocks with **higher probability (>70%) of price increase are preferred**.
        - **High-risk stocks (>30% probability of major loss) are removed**.

✅ **Final Output:**

- **Refined stock list with probability-based price targets & risk scores**.

---

### **3. Black-Scholes Model (Options Pricing & Risk Hedging)**

(*Used to determine fair value of stock options and assess investment risk.*)

✅ **Black-Scholes Formula for Call Option Price:**

                                                `$C = S_0 N(d_1) - Xe^{-rt} N(d_2)$`

Where:

- `$C$` = Call option price
- `$S_0$` = Current stock price
- `$X$` = Strike price
- `$r$` = Risk-free interest rate
- `$t$` = Time to expiration
- `$N(d_1)$` and `$N(d_2)$` = Cumulative normal distribution functions
- `$d_1 = \frac{ln(S_0/X) + (r + 0.5\sigma^2)t}{\sigma\sqrt{t}}$`
- `$d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{t}$`

✅ **Steps:**

1. **Retrieve market options data** for stocks in selection list.
2. **Calculate option price using the Black-Scholes model**.
3. **Identify stocks with undervalued options** (good for hedging).
4. **Evaluate implied volatility to confirm stock price trends**.

✅ **Final Output:**

- **Identify stocks with undervalued call options for potential leveraged gains**.

---

### **4. Composite Risk-Reward Score Calculation**

(*Combining all model outputs into a final risk-adjusted score.*)

✅ **Final Score Components:**

| Metric | Weight | Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DCF Valuation | 30% | Higher weight for undervalued stocks |
| Monte Carlo Probability | 30% | Stocks with >70% probability of price increase score higher |
| Options Pricing | 20% | Stocks with undervalued call options get a boost |
| Risk Adjustment | 20% | High-risk stocks are penalized |

✅ **Final Selection:**

- Rank stocks by composite score.
- **Top 15 stocks move to the final step for execution & alerts.**

---

### **Next Step**

Now that you have applied **DCF, Monte Carlo, and Black-Scholes models** refine the best stocks.

---

---

# **PART 4: Portfolio Diversification & Risk Management**

(*This step ensures that your selected stocks are diversified across sectors and have proper risk management strategies to minimize losses and maximize gains.*)

---

**Task Name:** Daily Pre-Market Stock Analysis (Part 4: Portfolio Diversification & Risk Management)

**Objective:**

Optimize portfolio allocation by ensuring **sectoral diversification**, **position sizing**, and **risk mitigation strategies** based on modern portfolio theory.

---

### **1. Sectoral Diversification Analysis**

(*Ensuring investments are spread across different industries to minimize risk exposure.*)

✅ **Steps:**

1. **Categorize the top 15 stocks** based on their sectors (e.g., Technology, Healthcare, Energy, Consumer Goods).
2. **Ensure no single sector exceeds 30% of the portfolio**.
    - If **one sector is overweight**, replace some stocks with **similarly ranked stocks from different sectors** to balance exposure.
3. **Verify correlation between stocks** using historical price movement:
    - Stocks with high correlation (>0.75) should be limited to avoid sectoral risk.

✅ **Final Output:**

- **A well-diversified portfolio with sector balance** (e.g., 3-5 sectors, not all tech-heavy).

---

### **2. Position Sizing (Allocating Capital per Stock)**

(*Determining how much to invest in each stock based on risk-reward ratio.*)

✅ **Risk-Based Position Sizing Formula:**

This is a commonly used **risk-based position sizing** formula. It tells you how many shares (the “position size”) you should buy so that your maximum possible loss (from your entry to the stop-loss) only exposes a certain percentage of your total trading capital.

                         `$Position Size  =  Total Capital×(Risk % per Trade)Stock Price  −  Stop Loss Price.\text{Position Size} \;=\; 
  \frac{ \text{Total Capital} \times (\text{Risk \% per Trade}) }{ \text{Stock Price} \;-\; \text{Stop Loss Price} }.$`

**Interpretation:**

- **Total Capital** is the amount of money you have allocated to your trading account.
- **Risk % per Trade** is how much of your capital you are willing to lose if the trade goes against you (commonly 1–2%).
- **Stock Price** (sometimes called Entry Price) is the price where you plan to buy the stock.
- **Stop Loss Price** is the price at which you will sell if the trade goes south.

By dividing the total dollars you’re risking (i.e., **Total Capital** × **Risk % per Trade**) by the per-share risk (i.e., **Stock Price** – **Stop Loss Price**), you determine the number of shares that keeps your loss within your chosen risk percentage if the stop loss is hit.

Where:

- **Risk % per trade** is set between **1-2%** of total capital.
- **Stop Loss Price** is determined using **support levels & technical indicators**.

✅ **Steps:**

1. **Calculate the ideal position size for each stock** using the formula above.
2. **Ensure no single stock has more than 10% of the total portfolio**.
3. **Reallocate funds if one stock is dominating the portfolio allocation**.

✅ **Final Output:**

- **Capital allocation breakdown per stock with predefined risk limits**.

---

### **3. Stop-Loss & Take-Profit Strategy**

(*Predefined exit strategies to lock in profits & minimize losses.*)

✅ **Stop-Loss Calculation:**

- Set stop-loss at **5-10% below entry price** (based on support levels & technical patterns).
- Adjust based on **volatility** (higher volatility stocks may need wider stop-loss).

✅ **Take-Profit Strategy:**

- Set target sell price at **20-30% above entry price** based on historical price movements & resistance levels.
- **If risk-to-reward ratio is <1:3, stock is removed from selection.**

✅ **Trailing Stop-Loss Strategy:**

- **If stock gains >15%**, move stop-loss to **5% below current price** to protect gains.

✅ **Final Output:**

- **Clear exit plan for each stock before entering trade** (reduces emotional decision-making).

---

### **4. Hedging Against Market Downturns**

(*Protecting the portfolio from sudden crashes using hedging strategies.*)

✅ **Hedging Strategies:**

1. **Inverse ETFs & Put Options**:
    - If market sentiment is **bearish**, allocate **5-10% capital in inverse ETFs or put options** on major indices (e.g., S&P 500).
2. **Gold & Bonds Allocation**:
    - If market volatility is high (VIX > 25), allocate **5-10% to safe-haven assets like gold or bonds**.
3. **Diversification Across Asset Classes**:
    - Include **at least 3 non-correlated asset types** (e.g., stocks, commodities, ETFs).

✅ **Final Output:**

- **Portfolio protection plan with hedging strategies in place**.

---

### **5. Portfolio Performance Tracking**

(*Setting up real-time alerts & tracking to monitor investment performance.*)

✅ **Daily Monitoring Plan:**

1. **Set real-time alerts for:**
    - Price crossing stop-loss or take-profit levels.
    - Sudden news affecting a stock (earnings reports, CEO resignations, economic policies).
    - **Unusual volume spikes** (potential trend shifts).
2. **Use Google Alerts, TradingView, or brokerage alerts** for real-time monitoring.
3. **At market close:**
    - Review stock performance & adjust portfolio allocation for the next day.

✅ **Final Output:**

- **Automated stock tracking & alerts system to ensure active risk management.**

---

Now you have ensured **proper diversification & risk control.**

---

# **PART 6: Advanced Risk and Macro Integrations**

The following enhancements build upon your current framework—covering **deeper risk analysis**, **scenario testing**, **cross-asset signals**, **factor exposures**, **insider & institutional data**, **options analytics**, and **ESG/alternative data**. Implementing some or all of these steps can help close gaps in your research process.

---

## 6.1 Deeper Risk & Correlation Analysis

### **Objective**

To detect whether your portfolio (or watchlist) is overexposed to specific sectors, industries, or market-wide factors by analyzing correlations and concentration risks.

### **Steps & Methods**

1. **Correlation Matrix**
    - **Why**: Two or more stocks with high correlation (e.g., 0.80+) will often move in tandem. Holding both doesn’t substantially reduce risk.
    - **Implementation**:
        - Use historical price data (e.g., daily returns over the last 6–12 months).
        - Compute pairwise correlation for each stock in your “Top 10–15” list.
        - Identify any clusters of stocks with correlation > 0.7 or 0.8; consider trimming or diversifying away from overlapping picks.
    - **Tools**: Python (`pandas.DataFrame.corr()`), Excel’s CORREL function, or built-in analytics on platforms like Finviz Elite/TradingView.
2. **Portfolio Beta & Volatility**
    - **Why**: Beta measures how volatile a stock (or portfolio) is relative to a benchmark (e.g., S&P 500).
    - **Implementation**:
        - Combine each stock’s Beta weighted by portfolio position size to calculate a portfolio-level Beta.
        - If portfolio Beta is > 1.2, expect sharper drawdowns in a market downturn; if < 1.0, your portfolio might lag in a roaring bull market but be safer in sell-offs.
    - **Action**: If Beta is too high, consider adding more defensive names (low Beta, stable dividends).
3. **Sector & Industry Exposure**
    - **Why**: Concentration in one sector (e.g., Tech) can lead to bigger swings if that sector underperforms.
    - **Implementation**:
        - Classify each stock by GICS sector or your own grouping.
        - Keep each sector to a *self-imposed maximum*—e.g., 25–30% weighting per sector.
    - **Visualization**: Build a pie chart or bar chart showing sector allocations.

### **Outputs & Decisions**

- A summary highlighting **largest correlations**, **sector exposures**, and **portfolio Beta**.
- Based on these insights, you might rebalance or swap out certain stocks to reduce overlap.

---

## 6.2 Scenario & Stress Testing

### **Objective**

To simulate how your holdings or watchlist might behave under extreme market conditions or specific macroeconomic shocks.

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Scenario Analysis**
    - Construct hypothetical situations:
        - *“What if the Federal Reserve raises rates an additional 1% unexpectedly?”*
        - *“What if oil prices collapse by 30%?”*
        - *“What if there’s a sudden trade-war escalation?”*
    - Estimate how each stock might respond, focusing on historical analogs (e.g., looking at 2018–2019 trade-war data, or 2008 crisis data).
2. **Historical Stress Tests**
    - Take real past crises—like the 2008 financial crisis, the 2020 COVID crash, or the 2011 European debt crisis—and see how stocks with similar profiles performed.
    - Use **historical drawdowns** to gauge “worst-case” moves.
3. **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** *(Optional, More Advanced)*
    - **Parametric VaR**: Assumes normal distribution of returns.
    - **Monte Carlo VaR**: Randomly simulates returns based on historical volatility/correlations.
    - Example: “At 95% confidence, the max I could lose in a single day is X% of my portfolio.”

### **Implementation Tips**

- **Quant Tools**: Python libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, or specialized platforms (e.g., Portfolio Visualizer, MATLAB).
- **Excel Stress Test**: You can create a scenario table to reduce the price of each position by historical worst-case percentages and see the portfolio-level loss.

### **Outputs & Decisions**

- A “**heat map**” of potential losses or price changes under each scenario.
- Identify which stocks are *most* vulnerable or *least* vulnerable, then weigh if the risk/reward is still acceptable.

## 6.3 Cross-Asset & Macro Data Integration

### **Objective**

To align stock picks with broader macroeconomic and cross-asset signals (bonds, commodities, currencies) that can impact risk sentiment or specific sectors.

### **Areas to Watch**

1. **Bond Market Signals**
    - **Yield Curve**: Look at the 2-year vs. 10-year Treasury spread. An inversion often signals recession fears.
    - **Credit Spreads**: Monitor corporate bond spreads over Treasurys—if spreads widen, it indicates rising default risk, which can spill over to equities.
2. **Commodities & FX**
    - **Oil & Gas**: Key for energy stocks, transportation, and overall inflation outlook.
    - **Metals** (Gold, Copper): Gold can be a safe haven; copper is a global growth barometer.
    - **Currencies**: If you invest in multinational companies, a strong USD can hurt earnings denominated in foreign currencies, and vice versa.
3. **Economic Releases & Calendars**
    - **CPI & PPI** (inflation), **GDP**, **PMI** (manufacturing & services), **Jobs Reports** (non-farm payrolls).
    - Sudden misses or beats can drive sentiment up or down quickly.

### **Implementation**

- **Daily/Weekly Macro Check**: Briefly look at where bond yields stand, any big commodity price moves, and upcoming economic releases.
- If your watchlist stocks are sensitive to these indicators (e.g., a gold miner, a heavy exporter), pay extra attention.

### **Outputs & Decisions**

- You might hold off on a purchase if yields are spiking and you see heavy correlation with interest-rate sensitive sectors (like Tech or Homebuilders).
- Conversely, if the macro environment appears supportive (e.g., falling rates, robust consumer spending), you might increase positions in cyclicals or growth stocks.

## 6.4 Factor & Style Exposure

### **Objective**

To see which “factors” or “styles” your holdings lean toward—Growth, Value, Momentum, Quality, Low Volatility—so you don’t accidentally load up on a single style that may underperform in a given cycle.

### **Key Points**

1. **Factor Definitions**
    - **Value**: Low Price/Earnings, Price/Book, high dividend yield, etc.
    - **Growth**: High EPS or revenue growth, potentially higher P/E.
    - **Momentum**: Stocks hitting new highs, strong 6- or 12-month performance.
    - **Quality**: Consistent earnings, stable returns on equity, low debt.
    - **Low Volatility**: Stocks with historically lower standard deviation of returns.
2. **Measuring Factor Exposure**
    - Some screeners (e.g., Finviz, Portfolio Visualizer, or FactSet) show factor tilt.
    - Alternatively, you can do a rough approximation: *“This stock has a P/E < 15, good dividend yield, so it’s Value-oriented.”*
3. **Balancing Factors**
    - Over the long term, diversification across factors can reduce drawdowns because different factors lead in different market phases.
    - For example, if you have only high-growth momentum names, a market rotation into value stocks can hurt performance drastically.

### **Implementation**

- **Tag each stock** with likely factor exposures.
- Summarize how much of your portfolio is Growth vs. Value, etc.
- Adjust if you see extremes—like 80% of your picks are all high-momentum Tech with minimal Quality or Value.

### **Outputs & Decisions**

- A balanced factor distribution can protect you from factor rotations.
- Or, if you have high conviction that Growth or Momentum is set to outperform near-term, you might *choose* to overweight that factor—but do so intentionally.

---

## 6.5 Insider & Institutional Positioning

### **Objective**

To gain insights from corporate insiders and big institutional investors (hedge funds, mutual funds) who often have deep knowledge or analysis budgets far beyond retail.

### **Data Sources**

1. **SEC Filings (Form 4, 13F)**
    - **Form 4**: Discloses insider buys/sells (C-suite, directors, 10% owners). Large insider buying can signal that management sees undervaluation or strong growth ahead.
    - **13F**: Filed quarterly by institutions with > $100 million in assets, revealing major positions or changes in holdings.
2. **Websites/Platforms**
    - **Quiver Quant**, **Capitol Trades**, **OpenInsider** for insider transactions.
    - **WhaleWisdom** or **SEC.gov** for 13F details.

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Insider Trades**:
    - Track net insider buying vs. selling over the last 3–6 months.
    - A cluster of insider buying is more meaningful than just one director buying, for instance.
2. **Institutional Activity**:
    - See if top hedge funds or mutual funds are adding or cutting positions.
    - For smaller/mid-cap stocks, a single large fund entry or exit can be a big sentiment driver.

### **Outputs & Decisions**

- You might upgrade a stock on your watchlist if you see strong insider buys.
- Conversely, if you notice heavy institutional selling ahead of earnings, that might prompt caution or deeper research.

---

## 6.6 Advanced Options Analytics

### **Objective**

To glean information about market sentiment, volatility expectations, and potential big-money trades by analyzing options data—even if you only trade the underlying stocks.

### **Key Focus Areas**

1. **Implied Volatility (IV)**
    - Reflects the market’s expectation of future price swings.
    - A sudden jump in IV can indicate looming announcements or potential stock volatility.
    - **Strategy**: If IV is extremely high, option prices may be “expensive.” If it’s low, it might be an opportunity for hedging at lower cost.
2. **Open Interest & Volume**
    - Look for **unusual options activity** (UOA)—large blocks of calls or puts that deviate from normal volume.
    - If you see a massive call option purchase at a certain strike, it could signal a big bullish bet.
3. **Put/Call Ratio**
    - High put/call ratio can signal bearish sentiment, while a low ratio can indicate bullish sentiment or complacency.
4. **Options Skew**
    - Compares implied vol across different strikes—can show whether the market is pricing in more downside vs. upside risk.

### **Implementation**

- Use platforms like **Barchart**, **Optionsonar**, **Market Chameleon**, or the **CBOE** site to track unusual options flow or implied volatility charts.
- Integrate the data into your daily/weekly check: *“Are we seeing any big new bets on XYZ? Does high IV suggest I should avoid or buy after the event risk passes?”*

### **Outputs & Decisions**

- If you notice bullish flows (large call buying) for a stock you already like fundamentally, that can reinforce your conviction to buy or hold.
- If you see massive put sweeps, it might be a red flag—worth investigating news or fundamental catalysts.

---

## 6.7 ESG & Alternative Data

### **Objective**

To account for **Environmental, Social, and Governance** factors, plus non-traditional data signals (e.g., web traffic, satellite imagery, social media sentiment). While not mandatory for every investor, ESG factors and alternative data often provide fresh insights and help anticipate controversies or growth trends.

### **ESG Insights**

1. **ESG Scores**
    - Providers like **MSCI, Sustainalytics, Refinitiv** offer ESG risk ratings.
    - A high ESG score can attract big institutional inflows, especially from pension funds or ESG-themed funds.
    - A low or controversial ESG record (e.g., lawsuits, environmental harm) can create headline risks.
2. **Controversies & Governance**
    - Track news about lawsuits, product recalls, labor disputes, or corporate governance red flags.
    - Governance issues (lack of board independence, questionable CEO behavior) can weigh on valuations.

### **Alternative Data**

1. **Web Traffic & App Downloads**
    - For consumer-facing companies (e.g., e-commerce or streaming), growing website visits or app usage can hint at robust quarterly sales ahead of official earnings.
2. **Satellite Imagery**
    - Used by some hedge funds for shipping traffic, retail parking lots, or farmland yields.
3. **Credit Card Transaction Data**
    - Summaries or aggregated data can reveal real-time consumer spending patterns.

### **Implementation**

- Decide if ESG matters to you for ethical or alpha-seeking reasons. If it does, incorporate basic ESG checks or controversies in your final watchlist.
- For alternative data, watch for big divergences between official guidance and what the data signals. This can be an early warning or opportunity.

### **Outputs & Decisions**

- Potentially **upgrade** or **downgrade** a stock if you discover major ESG controversies or find positive foot traffic data suggesting revenue beats.
- Weigh how “material” each factor is—some controversies may not matter long-term if fundamentals remain strong.

---

## Final Example Addition

If you were to add a **concise section** to your prompt specifically referencing these advanced data points, it might look like this:

> “In the Data Collection step, pull real-time global quotes from all major exchanges, including extended-hours data, commodity futures, and bond yields. Integrate institutional-level news from Reuters and Dow Jones. Collect advanced fundamental metrics such as EBITDA margins, EV/EBITDA, Piotroski F-score, and consensus analyst EPS estimates for 2–3 future years. For technicals, include Level II order book data, dark pool transactions, and full options chain analytics (implied vol, Greeks, open interest). Use macro indicators like yield curves, credit spreads, and the VIX. Incorporate institutional ownership data (13F filings) and factor exposures (Value, Momentum, Quality). In the risk management step, run Value-at-Risk (VaR), scenario stress tests, correlation analysis, and performance attribution. In the final report, provide TCA results, highlight any ESG controversies, and cross-check the final picks against major broker research targets.”
> 

By injecting these elements, you’ll **mimic the depth** that **Bloomberg Terminal** or **FactSet** users enjoy—bringing your daily pre-market analysis closer to an **institutional or hedge-fund-level** routine.

---

## Final Takeaway

- Any of these platforms will **far exceed** typical retail-focused services (e.g., Motley Fool, Zacks, Yahoo Finance Premium).
- The **“best”** depends on your **budget**, data needs (e.g., do you trade globally or only U.S.?), and **workflow** preferences (Excel modeling vs. in-terminal analytics).
- Large hedge funds often **subscribe to more than one** for redundancy and additional coverage. If cost is no barrier and you want the **ultimate pro-level** environment, **Bloomberg Terminal** is the typical starting point.
- Before making any investment, plug in current and accurate financials (from recent 10-Q/10-K, latest guidance).
